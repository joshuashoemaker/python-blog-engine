# python-blog-engine

This is a demo blog engine built on top of Google App Engine. This was a project of mine for my Udacity Fullstack Developer Nanodegree. 
This blog features a multi user system and a voting and commeting system.

In order to run past these to lines at the top of app.yaml and then run with google app engine:

application: blog-engine
version: 1
