# python-blog-engine

This is a demo blog engine built on top of Google App Engine. T
his was a project of mine for my Udacity Fullstack Developer Nanodegree. 
This blog features a multi user system and a voting and commeting system.

This project requires the Google App Engine to be install to run locally.

After installing Google App Engine and cloning this project, you can 
open the Google App Engine Launcher and add this projects folder as a 
project in Google app engine. Then point your broswer to the localhost 
port that it was set up on.
